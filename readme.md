An organization to store files associated with a potential remake of frag-z using c/c++

If this repository gets large enough I can start relocating to the frag-z organization.

Reasons to remake the game:
* I can develop the game without having to use the godot editor, meaning everything can be done from command line
* Makes automated builds easier
* Improve performance
* Have complete control over visual style
* We can use a typed programming language, improve debugging and testing

Tech Stack:
* SDL2
* bullet physics
* [enet](http://enet.bespin.org/)
